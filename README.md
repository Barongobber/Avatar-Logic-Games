# Avatar-Logic-Games
A logical thinking of making Avatar's element battle (involves the battle among water, earth, and fire) by using Assembly language.

## Objectives
1. Create a complicated game scenario using assembly language
2. Need to determine the level of the user (There would be 2 level in this case, which are normal stage and final/boss stage).

## Flow of the games
1. There would be 3 elements. Those are fire, water, and earth
    - The rule would be Water win againts FIRE & lose again EARTH, while FIRE will win agains EARTH

2. NPC will initial the game by showing their elements and the user just only need to pick any elements that will win over NPC's element

3. Right after winning over the minions (normal stage on the other words), boss will appear and will not even appear the elements that they have

4. User need to guess the elements that boss has and fight against boss' element.

5. If the user win for 3 times before having their lives run out, user will be win the fight.

NOTE: each user will have 3 life at the beginning of the games, and will lose 1 everytime they lost against the minion or boss.
